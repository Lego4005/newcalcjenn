# Active Context: Financial Advisor Marketing CRM Platform

## Current State

We have initialized the project with:

- Next.js 13+ with TypeScript and App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint for code quality
- Memory Bank documentation system

## Recent Changes

1. Project Initialization

   - Created new Next.js project with specified configuration
   - Added Memory Bank system
   - Set up initial documentation

2. Documentation Setup
   - Defined project requirements in projectbrief.md
   - Documented business context in productContext.md
   - Outlined technical architecture in techContext.md
   - Established system patterns in systemPatterns.md
   - Created progress tracking in progress.md

## Current Focus

Working on Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Authentication

- Setting up the foundational architecture
- Preparing for multi-tenant implementation
- Planning component library structure

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Infrastructure Setup

   ```bash
   # Set up Supabase
   - Create new Supabase project
   - Configure database schema
   - Set up Row Level Security policies

   # Configure Clerk
   - Create Clerk application
   - Set up authentication
   - Configure organization management

   # Initialize Trigger.dev
   - Create Trigger.dev account
   - Set up job processing
   - Configure webhooks
   ```

2. Environment Configuration

   ```bash
   # Create environment files
   - .env.local for development
   - .env.production for production
   - Add necessary API keys and endpoints
   ```

3. Base Component Development

   ```typescript
   // Start with core components
   - Button system
   - Form elements
   - Card components
   - Layout containers
   ```

4. Multi-tenant Foundation
   ```typescript
   // Implement tenant isolation
   - Middleware setup
   - Authentication flow
   - Organization management
   - Role-based access control
   ```

## Technical Considerations

### Current Challenges

- Setting up proper multi-tenant isolation
- Planning scalable component architecture
- Designing efficient data models

### Architecture Decisions Needed

- State management strategy
- API route structure
- Cache implementation
- Real-time update approach

### Security Focus

- Tenant data isolation
- Authentication flow
- API route protection
- Role-based access

## Development Environment

### Required Setup

```bash
# Node.js version
node -v  # >= 18.0.0

# Package manager
npm -v   # >= 9.0.0

# Development server
npm run dev
```

### IDE Configuration

- ESLint integration
- Prettier formatting
- TypeScript support
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense

## Team Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow atomic design principles
- Use TypeScript strictly
- Document all major components
- Write tests for critical paths

### Code Review Focus

- Type safety
- Security considerations
- Performance implications
- Multi-tenant compliance

Note: This document will be updated as development progresses and new contexts emerge.
