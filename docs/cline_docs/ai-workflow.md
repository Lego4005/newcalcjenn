# AI Memory Bank Workflow

## Starting a New Session

1. First Files to Read:
- projectbrief.md - Understand project requirements
- activeContext.md - Get current state
- tasks.md - See task status

2. Status Check:
```bash
npm run status
```
This helps me understand:
- Overall progress
- What's completed
- What's in progress
- What's remaining

3. Additional Context:
- systemPatterns.md - Architecture decisions
- techContext.md - Technical setup
- progress.md - Implementation progress

## During Development

1. Tool Usage:
- read_file - To examine file contents
- search_files - To find patterns/references
- list_files - To understand structure
- write_to_file/apply_diff - To make changes

2. Documentation Updates:
- Keep activeContext.md current
- Update task status
- Record decisions
- Track progress

3. Status Tracking:
- Monitor task completion
- Update progress metrics
- Check implementation status
- Verify changes

## Before Task Completion

1. Verify Changes:
- Check file modifications
- Verify functionality
- Update documentation
- Run status checks

2. Update Documentation:
- Record completed work
- Note any issues
- Document decisions
- List next steps

3. Final Status:
- Check task completion
- Verify progress
- Update metrics
- Document state

## Key Principles

1. Documentation First:
- Always read projectbrief.md
- Check activeContext.md
- Review tasks.md
- Monitor progress.md

2. Tool Usage:
- One tool at a time
- Wait for confirmation
- Verify results
- Document changes

3. Status Tracking:
- Keep tasks updated
- Monitor progress
- Track completion
- Document state

## Memory Reset Handling

Since my memory resets between sessions, I:
1. Always read projectbrief.md first
2. Check activeContext.md for current state
3. Review tasks.md for status
4. Use status check for progress
5. Document everything clearly

Remember: My memory resets completely between sessions, so thorough documentation is critical for maintaining context.
