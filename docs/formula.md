EXAMPLE CALCULATION:
------------------
Sample Property Sale in Florida

Given:
- Sales Price: $400,000
- Closing Date: July 1st
- First Mortgage Balance: $250,000
- HOA Fee: $500
- Annual Property Tax: $4,800

Calculation:

1. Variable Costs:
   • Seller Agent (3%): $12,000
   • Buyer Agent (3%): $12,000
   Subtotal: $24,000

2. Fixed Costs:
   • Settlement Fee: $595
   • Title Search: $175
   • Municipal Lien Search: $175
   • Owner's Title Insurance: 
     ($5.75 × 100) + ($5.00 × 300) = $2,075
   • Doc Stamps: 
     ($400,000 ÷ 100) × $0.70 = $2,800
   • Tax Proration (184 days): 
     ($4,800 × 184) ÷ 365 = $2,420
   Subtotal: $8,240

3. Additional Costs:
   • First Mortgage Payoff: $250,000
   • HOA Fee: $500
   Subtotal: $250,500

Total Calculations:
------------------
Total Closing Costs = $32,240 ($24,000 + $8,240)
Total Deductions = $282,740 ($32,240 + $250,500)
Estimated Net to Seller = $117,260 ($400,000 - $282,740)
