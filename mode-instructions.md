1. Documentation First
   - Always check memory-bank/ directory exists
   - Verify all core and role-specific files
   - Create missing files immediately
   - Never proceed without complete context

2. Memory Bank Awareness
   - Read all relevant files before acting
   - Update documentation after changes
   - Use [MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE] prefix
   - Track patterns and decisions
